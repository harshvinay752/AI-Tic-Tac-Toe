# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
An AI based game which plays tic-tac-toe taking decisions based on direct approach method and exhaustive search method in Python.

This AI based tic-tac-toe game first tries for a direct approach to best move, otherwise employes Exhaustive Search method for searching the
best possible move against the player, it maps all the possible next moves, and does the moves with greatest chances to win and lesser priority given to a tie-up.

Here, exhaistive search method is best technique to be employed because there are only 2^9=512 maximum possibilities which Python can go through quickly.
